# Oxygene Support for Coda

A work in progress, this is integration and plugin support for the Oxygene programming language (http://remobjects.com/oxygene) into Panic's awesome Coda web editor (http://panic.com/coda).

Included for now

* a Syntax Mode for using the oxygene language inside .aspx (& Co) files (still very rough).
